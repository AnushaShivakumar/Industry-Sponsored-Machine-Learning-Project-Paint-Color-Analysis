# Industry-Sponsored Machine Learning Project: Paint Color Analysis

### Project Overview

This project is an **Industry-Sponsored Machine Learning Research Project** carried out at the **University of Pittsburgh** in collaboration with **PPG Industries**. The primary objective of the project was to develop machine learning models to analyze and predict the properties and popularity trends of different paint colors. Through a combination of **RGB** (Red, Green, Blue) and **HSL** (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) data models, the project aimed to identify patterns and key factors that influence customer preferences for paint colors.

By leveraging these insights, **PPG Industries** was able to make informed, data-driven decisions to optimize their product offerings and better meet market demands. The project also provided recommendations to enhance PPG’s internal design tools by integrating machine learning capabilities for predictive analysis.

### Key Objectives
- Develop machine learning models to predict paint color properties.
- Analyze and understand customer preferences using historical color data.
- Provide actionable insights to improve PPG's design and marketing strategy.
